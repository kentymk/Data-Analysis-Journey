# Data-Analysis-Journey
It is my Data Analyst Journey since 2023

Throughout my professional journey, I have made a transformative shift from a successful career in sales management to pursuing my true ambition in data analysis. This shift was driven by my fascination with the power of data and its potential to drive meaningful insights and informed decision-making.
