# Data-Analysis-Journey
It is my Data Analyst Journey since 2023

With 12 years of experience in sales management, I have developed expertise in leveraging data to drive strategic decisions and measurable business impact. As a sales manager, I honed my analytical acumen by transforming granular sales data into compelling narratives that directly influenced outcomes. I found great fulfilment in distilling raw data into concrete, actionable strategies that uncovered hidden opportunities, improved business performance, and inspired stakeholders. This passion led me to pursue a career change into the field of data analytics, where I now seek to apply my analytical mindset and hunger for data-driven storytelling.

I am driven by the challenge of examining diverse datasets, deriving meaningful insights, and presenting data-backed recommendations to empower informed strategic planning. I stay dedicated to continuous learning and keeping updated on the latest tools to progress in this dynamic field. With my blend of communication skills, strategic approach, and analytical rigor honed through 10+ years in sales leadership, I am poised to deliver high-impact data analytics and insights that advance critical decision making.
